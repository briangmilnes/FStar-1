stage0: contains a starting point to start building F*, an ocaml
snapshot of an older F* that is capable of building the *current* F*
in this repo, i.e. the sources in src/. We update this snapshot
only when needed, it absolutely should not be update on every push to
master or every PR.

An alternative is using some external F* installed in your system instead
of the one in stage0, which also makes building a bit faster, since we skip
the dune build of the stage0
